# Email Templates for ContextKit Launch

## Pre-Launch Email (1 Week Before)

**Subject:** ContextKit launches on Product Hunt next week - can I count on your support? 🚀

**Body:**

Hey [Name],

Quick heads up: I'm launching ContextKit on Product Hunt next [Day], [Date] at 12:01am PST.

**What is ContextKit?**
Context-aware analytics SDK for iOS that automatically enriches every event with time, geo, device, and user context. Think Mixpanel but with automatic intelligent tagging.

**Why it matters:**
I discovered my app converts 2.3x better in Japan on weekends vs weekdays. I'd NEVER have found this manually segmenting Mixpanel data.

**The ask:**
Would you be willing to check it out and upvote if you find it useful?

I'll send you the link on launch day (targeting top 5 product of the day).

Either way, hope you're doing well!

Thanks,
Acesley

P.S. It's open source and has a free tier for indie devs: https://github.com/contextkit/contextkit

## Newsletter Announcement

**Subject:** Announcing ContextKit - Context-Aware Analytics for iOS

**Body:**

Hi everyone!

I'm excited to announce ContextKit, an open-source analytics SDK for iOS that I've been building for the past few months.

**The Problem**

As an indie iOS developer, I was drowning in Mixpanel events but couldn't figure out WHY my app converted differently across markets. Was it the time of day? The country? The device? I had to manually segment everything.

**The Solution**

ContextKit automatically enriches every event with contextual data:

- Time: hour, day of week, period (morning/afternoon/evening/night)
- Geo: country, region, locale, currency
- Device: model, OS, battery, network
- User: segment, session count, days active
- Session: duration, screens viewed

And the best part: **NO permissions required**. Uses only public iOS APIs.

**What I Discovered**

Using ContextKit in my own apps revealed insights I'd never have found manually:

✅ Japan users convert 2.3x better on weekends
✅ Germany users drop off 40% after 9pm
✅ iPhone 15 Pro users convert 1.8x vs iPhone 13
✅ WiFi users have 3.2x longer sessions than cellular

**How It Works**

Two lines of code:

```swift
import ContextKit
ContextKit.configure(apiKey: "ck_live_xxx")
```

Every event you track now includes full context automatically.

**What's Next**

Phase 1 (Available Now): Context-aware event tracking
Phase 2 (Q2 2026): AI diagnostics and anomaly detection
Phase 3 (Q3 2026): Cross-app benchmark database

**Try It Free**

- Free tier: 5K events/month

## Outreach to iOS Dev Influencers

**Subject:** Built something for iOS devs - would love your thoughts

**Body:**

Hey [Name],

I'm Acesley, an indie iOS dev from Hong Kong. I've been following your work on [specific thing] for a while - really appreciate what you share with the community.

I just built ContextKit, an analytics SDK that auto-captures context on every event (time, geo, device). It's helped me find conversion patterns in my apps that I'd never have discovered manually (like Japan users converting 2.3x better on weekends).

**Why I'm reaching out:**

I think this could be genuinely useful for iOS devs, but want feedback from experienced developers like you before going full-blast on promotion.

Would you be open to taking a quick look? Happy to send you a free premium account for life in exchange for honest feedback.

**Quick overview:**
- Open source, MIT license
- Zero permissions required
- Drop-in Mixpanel replacement with auto-context
- Free tier for indie devs

GitHub: https://github.com/contextkit/contextkit

No pressure at all - I know you're busy! Either way, keep up the great work on [their project].

Thanks,
Acesley

P.S. Launching on Product Hunt [Date] if you're interested in checking it out.

## Email to Podcast Hosts

**Subject:** Indie iOS dev built analytics SDK - podcast topic?

**Body:**

Hey [Name],

Love your podcast! The episode with [guest] on [topic] was particularly great.

I'm Acesley, an indie iOS dev, and I just built ContextKit - an analytics SDK that auto-captures context on every event.

**The backstory might make a good podcast topic:**

- Why existing analytics tools fail indie devs
- How I validated the idea (used it in my own apps first)
- Technical challenges (capturing context without permissions)
- Building in public on X/Twitter
- The "AI diagnostics" roadmap (Phase 2)
- Open source vs. paid tier business model

Already getting traction:
- [X] GitHub stars in [Y] days
- Processing [X]K events/day
- Featured on Product Hunt

Would this be interesting for your audience? Happy to share more details or do a quick call to see if it's a fit.

Either way, keep up the great work!
